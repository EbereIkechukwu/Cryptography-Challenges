# Diving into Cryptography Challenges Too!
I have also been brushing up on cryptography through hands-on challenges that really pushed me to think critically. Some of the ones I have completed include:

🧩 Crack the Hash

🔐 Guess the Password

🔑 RSA101

🧗 Up – which looked simple at first with its default settings, but took some creativity to solve.

These challenges helped me understand the logic behind encryption and decryption — how attackers might try to break it and how we can secure data properly.

It’s been exciting to actually do these things, not just read about them. Every tool I try, every flag I capture, brings me one step closer.
